# 🎮 SensAI Hackathon Demo: Proof-of-Active-Learning

## 🎯 **The Problem We Solved**

**Traditional EdTech Gamification is Broken:**
- Students game the system with clicks and idle time
- Points based on logins, not learning quality  
- No verification of actual engagement
- Leaderboards reward quantity over quality

**Our Innovation: Active Learning Minutes + Anti-Cheat**

---

## 🚀 **Our Solution: Quality-First Gamification**

### **Core Innovation: "Proof-of-Learning" System**

Instead of tracking:
- ❌ Login time
- ❌ Page views  
- ❌ Message count

We track:
- ✅ **Active Learning Minutes** (verified engagement)
- ✅ **Session Quality** (interaction depth analysis)
- ✅ **Learning Velocity** (progress per minute)
- ✅ **Meaningful Contributions** (peer reviews, deep practice)

---

## 📊 **What We Built (Complete System)**

### **1. 🧠 Smart Session Tracking**
```typescript
interface ActiveLearningSession {
  active_minutes: number;      // Only when engaged
  session_quality: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  learning_velocity: number;   // Progress per minute
  interactions_count: number;  // Meaningful interactions only
  anti_idle_verified: boolean; // Pattern detection
}
```

**Innovation**: Distinguishes between *time spent* vs *time learning*

### **2. 🎯 Weekly Quest System**
```yaml
Active Learner Challenge:
  Requirements:
    - 120 active learning minutes ⏱️
    - 3 Deep Practice (DP) passes ✅  
    - 1 peer review submitted 🤝
    - 80% average session quality 📊
  
  Verification:
    - Session tracking proves minutes
    - Task completions prove DP passes
    - Review submissions tracked
    - Quality calculated from interactions
  
  Rewards:
    - 500 learning points
    - "Active Learner" badge
    - 2 grace tokens
    - 10% leaderboard boost
```

### **3. 🏆 Multi-Scope Leaderboards**

**5 Different Scopes** (vs existing 1):
- **Course Level**: Cross-cohort competition
- **Cohort Level**: Enhanced existing system
- **Topic Level**: Skill-specific mastery
- **Campus Level**: Organization-wide rankings  
- **Global Level**: Anonymous cross-org competition

**3 Time Periods**: Weekly, Monthly, All-time

### **4. 🎫 Grace Token Anti-Cheat**
```typescript
GraceToken Types:
  - session_extension: +15 minutes for interruptions
  - quest_retry: Re-attempt failed weekly quest  
  - streak_save: Maintain streak despite missed day
  - quality_adjustment: Forgive one low-quality session

Economy:
  - Earn: Complete quests, help peers, maintain quality
  - Spend: Recover from genuine setbacks
  - Limit: Max 5 tokens, expire monthly
```

---

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Database Schema (5 New Tables)**
```sql
-- Session tracking with quality metrics
learning_sessions (18 columns, optimized indexes)

-- Quest system with flexible requirements  
weekly_quests + quest_completions (proof tracking)

-- Anti-cheat and user experience
grace_tokens (usage tracking, expiration)

-- Performance optimization
leaderboard_cache (sub-second response times)
```

### **API System (18 Endpoints)**
- **Session Management**: Start, update, track quality
- **Quest System**: Create, track, verify completion
- **Leaderboards**: 5 scopes × 3 time periods = 15 combinations
- **Grace Tokens**: Grant, use, manage economy
- **Analytics**: User profiles, recommendations

### **Integration with Existing System**
- ✅ Preserves all existing functionality
- ✅ Enhances current streak system (IST timezone)
- ✅ Links to existing chat/completion tracking
- ✅ Backward compatible with current admin panel

## 📈 **Demo Flow**

### **👩‍🎓 Student Experience**

1. **Starts Learning Session**
   ```bash
   POST /gamification/sessions/
   → session_id: 123, start_time: now
   ```

2. **System Tracks Active Engagement**
   - Meaningful chat interactions (weighted by length/complexity)
   - Code submissions and iterations
   - Time between interactions (idle detection)
   - Task progression velocity

3. **Real-Time Quest Progress**
   ```json
   {
     "weekly_quest": {
       "active_minutes": 45/120,
       "dp_passes": 1/3,
       "peer_reviews": 0/1,
       "completion": "32%"
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Leaderboard Position**
   ```json
   {
     "cohort_rank": 3,
     "course_rank": 12,
     "campus_rank": 45,
     "score_breakdown": {
       "active_minutes": 180,
       "session_quality": 0.85,
       "quests_completed": 2
     }
   }
   ```

### **👨‍🏫 Educator Experience**

1. **Quest Creation Dashboard**
   - Set weekly challenges for cohorts
   - Customize requirements and rewards
   - Monitor completion rates

2. **Enhanced Analytics**
   - Quality metrics vs just time spent
   - Identify students needing help
   - Track genuine vs superficial engagement

3. **Anti-Cheat Monitoring**
   - Suspicious pattern alerts
   - Grace token usage tracking
   - Quality score anomalies
